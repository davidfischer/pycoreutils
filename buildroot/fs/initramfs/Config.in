	  Integrate the root filesystem generated by Buildroot as an
	  initramfs inside the kernel image. This integration will
	  take place automatically.

	  The rootfs.initramfs file generated in the images/ directory
	  is only a text file describing the contents of the initramfs
	  in a format understood by the CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE kernel
	  configuration option.

	  Note that enabling initramfs together with other filesystem
	  formats doesn't make sense: you would end up having two
	  identical root filesystems, one embedded inside the kernel
	  image, and one separatly.
